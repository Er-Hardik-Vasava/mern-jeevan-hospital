# Jeevan Hospital - Hospital Website

## Overview

This **Hospital Management System** is a **full-stack web application** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It is designed to manage various hospital operations, including user roles (Admins and Patients), appointment management, and message handling. 

The system provides **separate dashboards** for **Admins** and **Patients**. Admins have full control over the platform, allowing them to manage users (Doctors and Patients), appointments, and messages. Patients can book appointments, track their status, and communicate with Admins or Doctors.

**Admin Dashboard:** Admins have the ability to manage users, view and handle appointments, and monitor communication.

**Patient Dashboard:** Patients can view available doctors by department, book appointments, and send messages to Admins or Doctors.

The application uses **TailwindCSS** to ensure a modern and responsive UI, providing users with a seamless experience across devices.
